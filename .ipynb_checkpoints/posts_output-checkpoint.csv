"Rugpulls and ""burned"" wallets","I have been experimenting with memecoins in the last days. I have discovered a pattern of Ivanka/Barron coins, where the holders almost always transfer their funds to the same address after a rugpull.

Initially, I made a bit about 100$ from an initial investment of 50$, by making 20% profits. By the next time I invested (again, same target address for funds after rugpull), they pulled liquidity at 20% gains (previously they always made \~100% gains).

So, i observed again, seeing them make 100% gains again, and again, and again. but every time I invested even 5$ (from the wallet I initially made earnings with), they would stop at around 15% to 25% gains.

Any ideas about this behaviour? I have done this a lot of times and it always the same pattern.",1,2025-01-26 05:26:08

Within the crypto space, capital is in flux as big business hedges its bets on the probable winners and losers. But it’s not just big business. Nation-states have gotten in on the act. 

El Salvador was the first to establish official reserves of Bitcoin. Now, several other countries are moving in that direction, including The U.S., China, Brazil, the U.K., Switzerland, Ukraine, Russia, and Bhutan, some as a result of seizing the assets of criminals and others as a result of executive foresight.

Shaquille O’Neal Finally Agreed To Pay $11M Over NFTs Scandal,"Hey guys, so I guess you all know about Shaquille O’Neal and the scandal surrounding the Astrals NFT project. Well, there is finally an update so I thought I could share it.



Quick recap — last year O’Neal was accused of hiding the risks of buying NFTs and not warning about the losses investors could have (and actually had) when the platform went down. 



By November 2022, the platform had shut down without any explanation or refunds for those who had purchased what turned out to be unregistered securities. As a result, investors filed a lawsuit against Shaquille O’Neal.



The good news is that Shaquille O’Neal finally agreed to pay $11M to investors who bought its NFTs. So, if you were damaged you can check the details and [file to get payment here](https://11thestate.com/cases/astrals-investors-settlement).



Anyways, were you damaged by this situation? How much were you losses?

Spoofing scam in Binance,"Spoofing scam on Binance

A person I know lost almost 50000€ in Ethereum and USDC. 

He received a message from Binance: [Binance] Your verification code is 889-937. If you did not request this contact us on +40 332 630 186 REF/931482.

He did the mistake to call this number and those guys explained to him that he had to transfer all the money from Binance exchange to a wallet via web3. (They even gave him their wallet seed phrase to connect to it and to send the cryptos). He did this because he thought it was everything legit.
After he realized that he lost his money, he talked with the real Binance employees via support center and they said to him it was a spoofing attack (they have lots of them everyday) and they can do nothing to get his money back.
He report this crime to police but I don't think they can solve this anymore.

Advice: Don’t fall for this scam even if the message comes from Binance, remember that Binance doesn’t have a phone number for support.

This is the scammers’ wallet:

AI Crypto Projects by Revenue: How Does OriginTrail $TRAC Compare?,"I put together a table ranking some top AI-driven crypto projects by their revenue and market caps. It’s intriguing to see how OriginTrail ($TRAC) stands out with a strong revenue-to-market cap ratio compared to other projects:

|Project|Revenue (Last 12 Months)|Market Cap|Revenue/Market Cap %|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||
|**NEAR**|$8M|$7.08B|\~0.11%|
|**OriginTrail (TRAC)**|$5.6M|$0.407B|\~1.38%|
|**ICP**|$2.82M|$4.34B|\~0.06%|
|**RNDR**|$1.54M|$3.93B|\~0.04%|
|**GRT**|$1.28M|$1.98B|\~0.06%|
|**AKT**|$1.05M|$0.98B|\~0.11%|
|**LPT**|$0.31M|$0.39B|\~0.08%|

# Key Observations:

1. **TRAC’s Undervaluation**: TRAC’s revenue-to-market cap ratio of \~1.38% is still far ahead of its peers. Despite a slightly higher market cap ($407M), it remains undervalued relative to its revenue compared to other projects.
2. **Real-World Usage**: TRAC powers OriginTrail’s Decentralized Knowledge Graph, which is already being adopted in supply chain, healthcare, and enterprise ecosystems. This makes it a utility-first project rather than one driven by speculation.
3. **Growth Potential**: With TRAC sitting at $407M in market cap, it has substantial upside. Scaling to market caps like RNDR or ICP (in the billions) would represent significant gains for holders, especially given its revenue metrics.

**Questions for Discussion**:

* Does TRAC’s revenue efficiency indicate its potential for larger adoption and market cap growth?
* Should market valuations better reflect actual revenue performance?
* What’s your take on TRAC compared to projects like RNDR or ICP in terms of innovation and utility?

Looking forward to your insights and a lively discussion!",42,2024-12-02 08:42:24

Or say I have only $20,000 and pay part of my bills off. say I pay $7.000 of my $10,000 I owe to get my bills down and then pay $7.000 of my dental bills. $6.000 into the checking account. How much will I have to pay come tax time for the long term capital gains?",3,2024-11-24 17:37:00

Am I Getting Scammed on GateHub?,"**I've got XRP on GateHub that has been on there since around 2018. I tried logging in for the first time since then to send to my ledger nano s plus and I've had issues. I was able to login, but it asked me right away to re-encrypt my account, which provided me with a new 32 character recovery code that I also wrote down. I have the old recovery code and now the ""new one."" I contacted support and they are saying that there was some issue with the ""re-encryption process"" due to the error ""error\_secret\_decrypt""**

**(automod doesnt like URLs so I replaced them)**

**I went to** (**support gatehub net)** **and used the form on the page to submit a support ticket explaining the issue. they responded with this suggestion:**

""Dear Sir or Madam,  
   
We have a possible solution to your issue.

We kindly ask you to access your account via the \[wallet2\] page, which will access the older version. After accessing your account copy-paste the following link to your URL bar \[gatrhub url /security /rekeyfix\], enter your current password and old password, or current password and old recovery key (received during the signup process) in the fields.

After completion of the mentioned ""Rekeyfix"" process, we kindly ask you to try re-encrypting your wallet once again (the step where you previously encountered the error). After a successful re-encryption log out of the account and access the updated version of our platform""

**The wallet2 url and the ""rekeyfix"" url just points back to** **gatehub** **and does nothing. I responded that it did not work, then they responded with:**

""Dear Sir or Madam,  
   
Due to the error message you received, which resulted in you being unable to access your account, we will refund the funds in your GateHub wallet(s).  
   
In order to proceed with recovering the funds in your GateHub account registered to email \[redacted\], we kindly ask you to register a new GateHub account using a different email address than you used to register your current account.   
   
We will refund it with the same amount of XRP that you are currently holding in your wallet.

Please respond once your profile information is filled in and documents uploaded, so we can review your verification request ahead of the queue.

 In addition, we would kindly ask you for additional information.   
   
Due to the error you are experiencing you cannot use the wallet, therefore, we kindly ask you to provide the old recovery key you received during the signup process or the old password you used prior to re-encrypting your account. Our development team is still working on identifying the cause of the issue that you have experienced and it would help us tremendously if you could share with us the original credentials from your old account.

 The recovery key is a 32-character key, generated during the GateHub signup process. It is generated only once. We suggest that you look through your computer files for a txt document titled ''gatehub\_recovery\_key'' you may have downloaded on \[2017\], the day you registered your account.

Please note that we are asking for obsolete data. The old recovery key received during the signup process is no longer valid since you received a new one during re-encryption, also the old password cannot be used to sign in to your GateHub account.

Kind regards,""

**Any concerns about this? I emailed security at gatehub net** **2 days ago but I have not received a response. Support is saying they will refund me the XRP in my account, however they need my old recovery key? This all seems strange and I'm very skeptical. My concern is that when I logged in, it prompted me to create a new recovery code which could be fake, and my first recovery code is still valid. Then when I send my ""old"" recovery code, they will gain access to my assets. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated. Thanks.**",2,2024-11-22 08:28:07

"Surging Adoption: The Wallet That's Taking the Crypto World by Storm""","
It's fascinating to see the growth of decentralized wallets lately, especially one in particular that saw nearly 6 million downloads in September alone, ranking just behind Binance in terms of new user growth. Bitget wallet has also surpassed 40 million users globally—more than double what it had back in March 2024.

A few things seem to be driving this surge. For one, it has a super user-friendly interface, making it easy for beginners to get started with crypto. Plus, it integrates a lot of Web3 services like asset management, swaps, trading, and staking, all in one place.

What’s really interesting is how it's tapping into the TON ecosystem and Telegram integration. This allows users to manage their assets directly through the messaging app, which is pretty convenient. They reported a crazy 4886% increase in TON on-chain addresses in Q3 alone.

It’s also expanding rapidly in emerging markets, with Africa leading the way—up 413% in Q3—followed by South Asia and the Middle East. This makes it one of the fastest-growing wallets in the space this year, especially for those new to crypto.

It'll be interesting to see how this momentum continues into 2024!",2,2024-10-21 14:09:44

Would appreciate hearing anyone’s experience whether it’s the customer support, withdrawals, fees etc. 

But specifically would like to know about peoples experience with futures on there.


Has anyone had a positive experience with mexc?
I hear a lot of bad stuff about them: unexpected mandatory kyc, withholding peoples money, messing up peoples trades. 

Maybe this is just because they’re the biggest non kyc platform so the bad rep seems a lot more than other smaller non kyc platforms.

Position closing at loss strategy discussion,"I'm running some bots with algorithms to trade for me. One of the fundamental parameters is defining when to open ""safety orders"" for the bot to DCA and average off the position so it gets back in profit quicker. Another of the parameters is HOW much the DCA is going to be, which obviously has a bigger or smaller impact in the average and PNL.

My question is, if you have a position that is already quite heavy with 3-4 DCAs already triggered (each weighing about 1.5x the existing position, so exponential growing and deepening the bags) and it has been running for very long, when is it reasonable to manually close the position at a loss?

I for example have a bag of BCH which is 220$ heavy and about -2$ down, if it ever gets in profit it will be netting me about 2-3$ in profit, but it's been so long that I'm thinking of just cutting it and letting go? In essence I need a trailing stop loss or something to cut it in case it drops further while I'm asleep...

TLDR: 

1- how do you space out your DCAs and how heavy you make them

2- how do you define your stop losses (time/value/weight,etc)",5,2024-09-30 15:51:36

🚨 Bitcoin in September Slump — is it the calm before the storm?,"NYDIG’s [latest report warns that September could be tough for Bitcoin investors, with the month showing a historic average loss of 5.9% since 2011](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-seasonal-slog-september-low-chance-near-term-positives-nydig). 

Greg Cipolaro from NYDIG says that near-term catalysts for Bitcoin are scarce, with most potential triggers coming from macroeconomic factors like inflation, employment, and Federal Reserve decisions.

While Bitcoin has gained 3% recently, riding on stock market performance, the real action might not come until later in the year. October and November have been historically strong months with historical gains of **16.1% in October and 40.6% in November**,

How Chinese crypto traders are dodging the ban,"Despite Beijing’s strict bans on crypto trading and mining, Chinese investors are still very much in the game. 

They’re using peer-to-peer trading on platforms like OKX and Binance, often accessing these sites with VPNs to bypass the Great Firewall. 

The 2021 mining ban didn’t shut everything down either—China still holds a big chunk of the global hashrate. 

Airdrop farming is booming too, with bots and even hired students farming tokens like it's a full-time job. 

While China ramps up its digital yuan, these crypto rebels keep finding ways to stay ahead.

Bitcoin whales on the move - highest level in 4 MONTHS!!!,"During the recent crypto market dip, Bitcoin whale transactions reached their highest levels since April! On August 5 and 6, wallets holding between 10 and 1,000 BTC rapidly accumulated as prices fell below $50,000. 

Santiment data revealed 28,319 transactions worth more than $100,000 and 5,738 transactions over $1 million during this period. Despite a sharp 18% drop, Bitcoin has bounced back to around $57,000.

CryptoQuant's CEO, Ki Young Ju, highlighted that over 400,000 BTC moved to permanent holder addresses since early July, indicating strong accumulation by new whales. Meanwhile, U.S.-based Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows of $554 million, raising concerns about the market's direction.

"Algorithmic, fiat-backed, or crypto-backed: Which stablecoin reigns supreme? ","

UST's collapse shook confidence in algorithmic stablecoins. 

Unlike UST, fiat-backed coins like USDT and USDC are backed by real-world assets, but they can still face risks like insolvency during mass redemptions. 

Meanwhile, crypto-backed stablecoins like Dai require over-collateralization, offering a more decentralized approach and greater resilience. 

Dai, in particular, has stood the test of time and stood strong during recent market chaos.

Are you on team crypto or team stocks?,"Are you more into crypto or stocks? It's a debate that keeps coming up as the financial world changes so quickly. Crypto fans love the decentralized nature, cutting-edge technology, and the potential for big returns. Meanwhile, those who stick with stocks appreciate the stability, proven track record, and the fact that they're tied to real companies. Each has its own perks and downsides, making the choice between crypto and stocks a hot topic for anyone interested in investing. So, which side are you on – the exciting world of cryptocurrencies or the solid ground of stock markets?

Is there any legit bitcoin lending websites?,"Anybody know any good legit bitcoin lending websites, metamask or defi or w/e?

Oh there's one website, not sure if it's legit can someone give me their 2 cents on it? it's called, liquidium (dot) fi.

  
Update: liquidium is a scam website. On some website the coin/token is a scam. It also ask for your API/keys to your ledger or wallet, a HUGE red flag, as you don't deposit anything in their website?

"After checking out R/Bitcoin, I decided to cash out my bitcoin","As an accountant at an insurance firm, I started putting $5 a day into bitcoin about 8 months ago, mainly as a speculative move. I wasn't too bothered if I lost it all.

But things started feeling off when bitcoin hit its old peak and stalled. So, I did some digging on r/Bitcoin and man, it's wild out there!

The discussions lacked basic macroeconomics, yet people tossed around terms like they were Warren Buffett. Two points really got me:

1. The whole 'BTC is scarce' argument fell flat for me. Scarcity means nothing if no one wants it, even if there are only 21M coins. Econ 101, folks.
2. The 'halving cycle means moon' mantra doesn't hold water anymore with 94% of bitcoin already out there. The slow increase in supply isn't moving the market, and new buyers aren't lining up.

So, I'm out. If these kinds of ideas are what's driving bitcoin's price, I'm not convinced about its future growth. Happy to be part of this community now",8,2024-07-03 12:42:49

 How much programming skill is necessary to trade? ,"Programming knowledge can make or break your strategies. Here’s a streamlined guide from an experienced algo trader who has automated his trading:

**Why Programming Matters?**

**1)Customized Strategies**: Programming skills allow you to create unique trading algorithms tailored to your style and market conditions. Python is known for its flexibility, while languages like MQL are designed for platforms like MetaTrader.

**2)Data Analysis**: Algorithms thrive on data. With programming, you can process large datasets, back-test strategies, and uncover trends that manual analysis might miss, leading to more informed trading decisions.

**3)Automation**: Automated trading systems execute trades around the clock based on predefined rules. Programming knowledge lets you customize and optimize these systems for better performance and profitability.

# Popular Programming Languages for Algotrading

* **Python**: Popular for its simplicity and flexibility, used for developing strategies, data analysis, and automation.
* **R**: Known for its powerful statistical and analytical capabilities, ideal for data analysis and modeling.
* **MQL (MetaQuotes Language)**: Used for developing trading robots and indicators on MetaTrader, providing direct access to trading terminals.
* **Java and C++**: Used for high-frequency trading systems and complex algorithms, offering control over system resources and performance.

**Emergence of Automation Platforms**

Automation platforms simplify trading with drag-and-drop interfaces, templates, and ready-made algorithms. They save time and ease the learning curve but should not replace a deep understanding of trading principles. For example, platforms like Tamap, TSLab, and MetaStock offer automation without requiring advanced programming knowledge, allowing traders to focus on strategies and risk management.

# Additional Tips for Algotraders

* **Continuous Learning**: Stay updated with industry trends, new technologies, and algorithmic methods through forums, courses, and publications.
* **Risk Management**: Understand and implement risk management strategies. Programming skills can help in creating protective measures and managing position sizes effectively.
* **Collaboration and Community**: Engage with trading communities and forums for insights, strategies, and feedback from fellow algo traders.
* **Thorough Backtesting**: Conduct comprehensive backtesting to ensure strategies are robust across different market conditions and historical data.

By incorporating programming into your trading toolkit, you can enhance your strategies and improve performance in the fast-paced world of algotrading.",37,2024-06-25 12:39:24

Community-Driven vs. Developer-Driven Crypto Projects: Which Wins in the Long Run?,"Hey guys,



Been thinking about something lately and wanted to pick your brains community driven projects VS ones driven by the developers themselves. Both have their PROS and CONS, but which do you reckon sets up a crypto project for long term success?

Alright, so community driven projects are all about the people power. The cool thing is the energy it brings when the communitys fired up and feeling involved, magic happens. They're not just users that on some cases have thousands of $ on that coin, so they are not letting it slide; BUT sometimes, with everyone shouting different things, decisions take forever. And if the party dies down, so does the project. There is some developer driven projects with a lot of power because of how good there team is structured. Ive seen this in coins like $CEEZUR and $ALBART

Then there are the developer-driven projects, where it's like a squad leading the charge. These guys IF THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING have a vision, a roadmap, and they're sticking to it. It's like having a captain steering the ship through the stormy seas of crypto. With a clear direction and strong leadership, progress is steady. But, and it's a big but, sometimes they can be a bit out of touch. If they're not listening to the community, things can go south real quick. Plus, if the core team SELLS, everyone is out, this is whats usually known as a RUG or NOT, they are also some community driven projects that have been able to push thorugh BIG rugs and do not give up.

So, personally, I reckon it's all about finding that sweet spot. A mix of both could be the secret sauce. You got the devs laying down the groundwork, making the tough calls, while the community's there, cheering them on, giving feedback, and keeping things real. It's like a tag team, each bringing something special to the table.

What do you think about this? And where would you invest your money??",9,2024-06-06 20:54:19

Maybe this will be useful at least for someone. If you have questions, don't be afraid to ask, I will be happy to help you.

* Reading crypto charts is a big part of learning how to know when crypto will rise or fall.

The future of crypto,"What do you think about the future of crypto? Found this article and it gives these key points: 

* Various benefits of cryptocurrency include promoting financial inclusion, facilitating cost-effective international transactions, and offering the potential for high returns and portfolio diversification. 
* Cryptocurrency has fostered innovation in a wide range of industries, such as eCommerce, supply chain management, and healthcare. 
* Cryptocurrency values can fluctuate significantly, with prices changing dramatically over short periods. While some investors may view this volatility as an opportunity to capitalize on crypto's potential gains, it also exposes them to risks, such as potential losses resulting from unpredictable price swings. 

Do you think it will become the main financial instrument? Because while you are not digging in the world of crypto, it looks like nobody is talking about this and when you start getting more into this, it looks like it can really become the main one.

Bitcoin Mining Cost Drops to $45K as Inefficient Miners Exit: JPMorgan,"JPMorgan reports that Bitcoin mining costs have fallen to $45k from over $50k as inefficient miners leave the network after the halving. The current hashrate and power consumption suggest this decline. The bank anticipated this drop after the halving, but with a delay, attributing it in part to the launch of the Runes protocol, which caused a temporary increase in transaction fees. Hashrate means the total computing power on the BTC network. This decrease reflects the adjustment after halving miner rewards by 50%.",0,2024-05-16 18:33:20

Why do people borrow on crypto platforms?,"I've observed that a majority of lending platforms require you to provide collateral that matches or exceeds the loan amount on a 1:1 basis, if not more.  
It's quite common for these platforms to cap the borrowing limit at 75% of the collateral value.  
Considering this, why would someone opt to borrow cryptocurrency by locking in another as collateral, instead of just trading them directly on an exchange? Especially when exchanges often offer much lower rates compared to the hefty ones seen on DeFi lending platforms?",5,2024-05-08 16:14:38

Here are 3 metrics to analyze the market without looking at the price of BTC,"Hey, 

ever noticed how BTC at $63k can feel totally different from one week to the next?

Now you might wonder why.

Sure, market sentiment is a big factor, but there’s more to it.

Think about this: When BTC was at $16k in 2017, everyone was euphoric.

Fast-forward to 2022, and BTC hits $16k again, and suddenly, everyone's in despair.

Even though the price was the same, the onchain metrics painted a vastly different picture.

In 2017 they were overheated and in 2022 they were oversold.

The biggest mistake most investors make is that they never look at onchain metrics.

**That’s why I will share my top 3 on-chain metrics with you so that you can identify the best time to sell near the peak.**

The three metrics can help you time the market without needing to look at the price of BTC are:

- **MVRV**
- **NUPL**
- **Puell Multiple**

## Let’s start with MVRV

**1️⃣ MVRV (Market value realized value)**

This metric measures whether Bitcoin is overvalued compared to its historical average.

If MVRV exceeds 2, it indicates that the current price is much higher than what most holders paid, suggesting that we are moving towards the peak.

However, keep in mind the MVRV has exceeded 4.0 in 2021 which shows it can go much higher than expected.

You can look at the current BTC MVRV value [here](#).

## 2️⃣ NUPL (Net unrealized profits and loss)

NUPL identifies the overall market sentiment by showing the proportion of Bitcoin holdings in profit or loss.

A NUPL value in the ""greed"" zone (above 0.7) is very strongly correlated with market tops.

The higher it goes the stronger the sell signal.

You can look at the current NUPL value [here](#).

## 3️⃣ Puell Multiple

This onchain metric compares the daily earnings of Bitcoin miners against the average over the past year. 

View the Puell Multiple chart [here](#).

**Here’s how to use the Puell Multiple:**

Puell Multiple > 2.5 = You should sell up to 25%+ of your BTC/alts on upward moves. This will give you a lot of capital to buy back during capitulation events.

Puell Multiple > 5 = You should be selling 75%+ of your BTC portfolio. Furthermore, you must set sell orders for your altcoins, as they often pump after BTC pumps. 

If you want a more in-depth read with charts and links then read this version [here](https://onchainedge.beehiiv.com/p/my-3-favorite-onchain-metrics-btc-top-signals).",3,2024-05-06 02:53:16

Bitcoin Halving Overshadowed by Launch of Runes Token Protocol,"The launch of Runes, a new protocol created by Casey Rodamor, has caused a stir in the Bitcoin community. Runes allows users to mint tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, similar to Ordinals, but with a focus on meme coins. This has led to a surge in activity and fees on the Bitcoin network, as users rush to mint their own tokens. Some believe that early projects and those with catchy ticker names will be the most valuable, while others are still trying to understand the potential of this new technology.

"Despite Pre-Halving Dip, Bitcoin Price Remains Poised for Growth.
","Despite a brief dip below $60,000 due to pre-Halving jitters and market uncertainty, Bitcoin remains bullish in the long term. The Halving event, historically a positive catalyst for Bitcoin's value, is approaching, and some investors see the recent price correction as a positive sign of leverage being flushed out of the market. Additionally, increased buying of longer-dated call options suggests anticipation of higher Bitcoin prices later this year. Furthermore, the recent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF market in Hong Kong is expected to boost adoption and price.

What is your opinion on Fiat-backed stablecoins? Do you believe they fit in with the principles that have started the Cryptocurrency revolution?,"Fiat-backed stablecoins are gaining an increasingly significant importance in the crypto market. They are an asset perceived as less volatile and a good way to enter and cash out the cryptocurrency markets.  
There are billions of dollars in these fiat-backed stablecoins, but as they gain increasingly more importance is important to research and reflect, what are the risks associated with this kind of cryptocurrency?  
In this podcast, we dive deeper into fiat-backed stablecoins, with a focus on USDC to understand their goals, beliefs, and how it all fits in on the wider picture and the values of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin: https://youtu.be/nujdDbmyUOo?si=o42PKZS3i8XCwTfi   
It’s actually scary some of the risks these stablecoins bring, such as loss of freedom, privacy, decentralization, and financial empowerment, as well as the trust you need to deposit on an intermediary. We really need to ask ourselves, how much are we willing to risk and lose for a quick buck?

Help! I'm new and don't know how to cash out my crypto!!!,"Hi!

I am new to crypto and I made some 50x returns recently on Ton Token. Note: this isn't Toncoin. It is Ton Token. 

These returns basically evaporated because I cannot figure out how to get my tokens converted to USD and cashed out of my wallet!!

I purchased the tokens through Coinbase Wallet. However, they do not officially support these tokens. So, after much trial and error, I found Nufinetes Multi-Chain Wallet which DOES support this particular token.

I managed to get them sent to that wallet, but I have no clue how to get my earnings out!

The tokens have dropped back down to their original value and I'm hoping they will pump again. But I need to know how to get them out next.

Can anyone help me or recommend a more user friendly (compatible) wallet to send them to so I can cash them out when the time comes?

Thanks!",1,2024-04-18 02:40:37

Sharing my old solana bundle.,"Greetings, fellow crypto aficionados!  
  
Reading your posts gave me the urge to tell you about my old bundle which was one of my first bundles which I discovered much time ago. Sit tight as I dissect my strategic, devoid of embellishment but rich in substance.  
  
To test it out, I decided to deposit $3150 into Solana, I initiated a seamless transition to USDT, witnessing a commendable upsurge to $3469.  
  
I also used different tactics – from the patient 'HODL' stance to strategic liquidations for real-world acquisitions. Because prudent fiscal management remains paramount amidst the allure of crypto's allure.  
  
Presently,I have 10,000$ on my balance and my focus pivots towards opportune timings, awaiting the ascent of ligament percentages. Patience, after all, is the cornerstone of prudent arbitrage.  
  
Why divulge this narrative, you ask? Beyond the facade of self-aggrandizement lies an earnest desire to embolden fellow enthusiasts. Let us convene, to share insights and fortify our collective understanding of the crypto domain.  
  
What methodologies do you employ in your arbitrage endeavors? What binders anchor your strategies amidst the volatile tides of crypto? Let us unravel the complexities together, forging a community steeped in knowledge and camaraderie.  
  
Also below are screenshots of my way.  
  
[Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/59N0uCG)

  
P.S. Right now this bundle still works, and despite the fact that the profit percent in this bundle is not so much, the main advantages are that you don't need to go through KYC to scroll. On the exchange it is written that verification is required only for deposits over 400SOL. idk if it's true, but deposits from 50-100sol pass through without any verification. I rarely use this bundle in cause I already discovered a new one with a bigger profit so idc about sharing it. If I'll find smth better then my current one, I will also share it with you. Also, I would be reallly pleased if you could tell me about your approaches and experience in this world of arbitrage. :3",1,2024-04-04 01:26:03

I analyzed the Last 3 Bitcoin halvings here's what I think will happen after the 2024 halving,"Hi

If you've never experienced a Bitcoin halving before, or if you have but are unsure what to expect, I've done a bit of research based on the last halvings. Here's what i have. 

The halving occurs every four years, cutting the reward for mining new blocks in half. The next halving will reduce rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC.

Historical Price Impacts:

* 2012 Halving: Bitcoin's price surged approximately 9308% in 13 months.
* 2016 Halving: Saw a 2861% increase over 17 months.
* 2020 Halving: Resulted in a 620% increase in 11 months.

Based on some napkin math the BTC can reach a 162% price increase post-halving, with the peak expected around 420 days (14 months).

inb4 no one knows shit about anything. It's a probability game.

What's your take.

Historical Data Scanning/Screening Crypto Pairs,"Hey guys, im looking to investigate trading in crypto markets. I have plenty of familiarity with the general markets as someone who has been a crypto user for many years, however ive ran into a bit of a dilemma.

I want to deploy a strategy alongside a scanner/screener that will alert for me whenever certain volume, price, and market cap criteria are met. This sort of opportunistic approach to trading cryptocurrencies seems to be common, but how do you go about backtesting such a system if I dont know when my scanner alerted in the past?

Im looking for a scanner that offers DATE as an input parameter, so I can look at what my scanner would have outputted on a prior historical date. This sort of tool is surprisingly hard to come by. Even in stock trading I had to search quite hard to find this sort of tool, especially for a reasonable price. I already have historical charts, I just need to know what my scanner would have alerted.

The closest thing ive found so far that is helpful is [this CMC link](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/) that provides basic price, market cap, and volume info on some historical dates. Purchasing/acquiring .csv time and sales data *might* be an option, however it will be difficult to work with (id have to sort through (and purchase) data for every single crypto pair), and is the worst case scenario. For comparison, I use [ChartMill](https://www.chartmill.com/stock/stock-screener) right now for stock trading (its truly an incredibly powerful tool, I highly recommend it for stock traders), im looking for something EXACTLY like this, except for coins. My last resort is to compile the data myself by just documenting my scanner alerts for the next few months...

Any advice is helpful, thanks.",1,2024-03-22 03:59:53

Bitcoin Adds 277K Small Holders In 2 Weeks Amid ATH,,21,2024-03-13 21:01:47
Question regarding leverage,"Adressed to anyone experienced with leverage trading:  


Following scenario:  


Put a small chunk of money into 60x Leverage on Bitget at BTC roughly around 40k or whatever, With the profits, kept increasing the position(BTC exposure) but kept the same leverage. Rode it all the way until now - position is still open and in massive profit. Stop loss is nicely positioned above Liquidation price, therefore prove it safe.   


Only downside are the Funding rates. Solid amount being added to the owed fees (which will eventually get deducted from the winnings when closing the psoition).  


Question now: Given I want the SAME amount of BTC exposure to the market - is it smarter to keep the Position open now with the 60x leverage or would you rather close the original position, then open a new one with a lower lever but then obviously put more capital from the winnings of the original position in. I am not sure which way is ""cheaper"" in terms of fees etc.  


Thanks for any advice. Please no ""its gonna drop, get out"" kinda comments - you dont know the entire picture of my position/situation, and I would like to have this case looked at individually without factoring in the future price.",1,2024-03-13 17:14:54

Liquidation Short Position Bitget,"Hi everyone,

I am new to short selling and want to learn how to calculate the price at wich a short position will be liquidated.

I want to use bitget as a platform and I am going to start without leverage.   
Do you know if bitget provides information at wich price a spot short position will be liquidated?

I tried to find a formular myself but the docu of bitget is very confusing. I was hoping somebody else has made that calculation before and is willing to share it with me.

Thank you in advance, if anybody is taking the time to answer my question.:)",1,2024-03-04 21:57:32

The holy grail of memecoin profitable trading,"I'm using my ""serious"" play money account (that is, the one in which I try to earn as if it were real money) to test-trade top memecoins (at least 250M$ MC).

It started both as a game and as a scientific experiment but as time goes on, I'm getting more and more baffled.
The point is that I seem to be able only to lose money while they (most at least) grow unreasonably.
Maybe it's because shorting them beats me... But really: do you make any money (even fake money) trading them?
Even if they're heavily manipulated by the creators and are just a joke, I can't believe there's no ""systematic"" way to gain money trading them...

Bitcoin Slips Under $42K in Wake of Fed’s Hawkish Tone,"In the aftermath of the Fed’s hawkish tone, Bitcoin slid by 5%, slipping below $42,000 from $43,700.

Major altcoins, including Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano, followed suit, experiencing drops of at least 10%. According to Coinglass, over $200 million in crypto-tracked futures were liquidated following Powell’s press conference.

**On the Flipside**

* The FOMC has kept interest rates unchanged for four straight months.
* Following the Fed chair’s comment, traditional markets suffered their worst day in four months.
* Over 98% of analysts predict the FOMC will remain hawkish until May 2024
* While the economy exhibits robust activity levels, experts caution that Powell’s non-committal stance on future rate hikes might create uncertainty and hinder long-term planning for businesses and investors.
