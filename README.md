# Regime Switch Detection
## Overview
Regime detection has been a crucial field of investigation ever since the market crash in 2009. Broadly speaking, the stock market oscillates between two states: Bearish and Bullish, signified by a period of great volatility and steady growth, respectively. In this project, we aim to predict the aforementioned regimes by examining the trading data of stocks for several companies in various sectors. Additionally, we incorporate sentiment analysis in the previous analysis and investigate possible correlations.
